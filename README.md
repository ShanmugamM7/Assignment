# Assignment
 I have tried different ways to accomplish the task.
 Captured different results for different approaches.
 The main1, main2 and main3 are the code files with .py and ipynb extensions.
 At the last you need to provide the imagepath that I have mention in the code also.
 Install the latest version of libraries cvzone, mediapipe and opencv-python before running the code.
